# AI & IoT-Driven Early Warning System for Landslides and Floods

## Project Overview

Natural disasters such as landslides and floods frequently occur in hilly regions due to heavy rainfall, soil instability, and rising water levels.

This project proposes an AI and IoT-based smart early warning system that continuously monitors environmental conditions using multiple sensors and predicts potential disasters using machine learning algorithms.

The system provides real-time alerts to communities and authorities to enable timely preventive action.

## Problem Statement

Traditional disaster monitoring systems:

- Depend mainly on rainfall data
- Provide alerts after visible warning signs
- Require expensive infrastructure

There is a need for a low-cost, real-time predictive early warning system.
