#  AI & IoT-Driven Early Warning System for Landslides and Floods

##  Project Overview

Natural disasters such as landslides and floods frequently occur in hilly regions due to heavy rainfall, soil instability, and rising water levels.

This project proposes an AI and IoT-based smart early warning system that continuously monitors environmental conditions using multiple sensors and predicts potential disasters using machine learning algorithms.

The system provides real-time alerts to communities and authorities to enable timely preventive action and reduce loss of life and property.

##  Problem Statement

Traditional disaster monitoring systems:

- Rely mainly on rainfall data  
- Are expensive and infrastructure-heavy  
- Provide alerts only after visible warning signs  

There is a need for a low-cost, real-time, predictive early warning system for vulnerable regions.

---

##  Proposed Solution

Our system integrates:

- IoT-based environmental sensors  
- Microcontroller-based data acquisition  
- Cloud data transmission  
- AI-based disaster risk prediction  
- Real-time alert notification system  

The AI model classifies risk levels as:

- 🟢 Low Risk  
- 🟡 Medium Risk  
- 🔴 High Risk  

When threshold levels are exceeded, automatic alerts are triggered.

##  System Architecture

1. Sensors collect environmental parameters.  
2. Microcontroller processes raw data.  
3. Data is transmitted to the cloud server.  
4. AI model analyzes data and predicts risk level.  
5. Alerts are sent to users and authorities.

##  Objective

To minimize human casualties and infrastructure damage by providing early warnings before landslides and floods occur in vulnerable hilly regions.

---

##  Innovation

This system combines:

- Multi-sensor IoT data  
- AI-based predictive analytics  
- Real-time alert mechanisms  

Unlike traditional systems, it focuses on **prediction before disaster occurrence**, not just detection.
