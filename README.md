# AI and IoT-Driven Early Warning System for Landslides and Floods

##  Project Overview
Natural disasters such as landslides and floods frequently occur in hilly regions due to heavy rainfall, soil instability, and rising water levels. This project proposes an AI and IoT-based smart early warning system that continuously monitors environmental conditions using multiple sensors and predicts potential disasters using machine learning algorithms. The system provides real-time alerts to communities and authorities to enable timely preventive action.

##  Features
- Real-time environmental monitoring using IoT sensors
- AI-based disaster prediction and risk analysis
- Automatic early warning alerts (Mobile / SMS / Alarm)
- Cloud-based data storage and visualization dashboard
- Low-cost and scalable deployment for remote areas
- Historical data analysis for better disaster planning

##  Technology Stack
- ESP32 / Arduino Microcontroller
- IoT Sensors (Soil Moisture, Rainfall, Water Level, Vibration)
- Python Programming
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Cloud Platform (Firebase / AWS)
- Mobile Application / Web Dashboard

##  Objective
To minimize loss of human life and infrastructure damage by providing early warnings before landslides and floods occur, especially in vulnerable hilly regions.

##  Innovation
The system combines multi-sensor IoT data with AI-based predictive analytics to provide accurate and timely disaster warnings, which is more effective than traditional monitoring methods.
